SHORT ANSWER

1.Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: to think through, develop, & communicate the steps of an algorithm outside of any particular programming language.


2.If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: nothing? and errors.

PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

A:

INPUT 1st number
INPUT 2nd number
  IF 1st number > 2nd number THEN  
    PRINT 1st number
  ELSE
    PRINT 2nd number
  ENDIF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

A: 

FOR 
  INIT number = 1
  WHILE number <= 100
  PRINT number THEN
  INCREMENT number

  ENDWHILE
ENDFOR

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

READ phoneBook
INPUT searchInput
FOR
  INIT item = 1st item in phoneBook list
  WHILE item <= number of all items in phoneBook list
    AND item != searchInput
    INCREMENT item in phoneBook list

    IF item === searchInput THEN
      RETURN location of item

      ELSE
      PRINT no item matches your search
    ENDIF
  ENDWHILE
ENDFOR

4. Implement the pseudocode from previous question.

```
var phoneBook = ["Will", "Fonda", "Hendrix", "Jemisin"];

function search(name) {
  for (let i = 0; i< phoneBook.length; i++) {
    if (phoneBook[i] === name) {
      console.log(name + " is found at index " + i);
      return true;
    } else {

    }
  }
  console.log("No items match your search.")
  return false;
}


search("Hendrix");

```
